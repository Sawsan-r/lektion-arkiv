# How to Run Lektion Arkiv Locally

Since this is a modern React application, it requires **Node.js** to build and run.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Install Node.js**:
    *   Download and install the "LTS" version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
    *   Follow the installation prompts (default settings are fine).

## How to Start

Once Node.js is installed, you can simply double-click the `start_app.bat` file in this folder.

Or, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start the app
npm run dev
```

The application will usually start at `http://localhost:8080`.
